# TOP_BuildingWithBackgroundAndGradients

It takes a couple of days to finish the project. I have read code from several sources and chose Lucas-bide as the model to follow.   

What I learned most from the project is to use background property in css to display elements in the page. Especially in the navigation bar where is used one picture to display rather than an unordered list.
